# raspberry_pi_mini_projects

The Raspberry Pi is a line of tiny single-board computers created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in collaboration with Broadcom in the United Kingdom. It's a low-cost, credit-card-sized computer with a conventional keyboard and mouse that connects into a computer display or TV. It's a powerful small gadget that allows individuals of all ages to learn about computers and programming languages like Scratch and Python.

• Use of Raspberry Pi in the project: It is the heart of the project as all circuits and modules made are connected and coded on the Raspberry Pi.

• Model Used: Raspberry Pi 3 B+

### Mini Project Details : 
1. Control Lights: 

The aim of this project is to connect the LEDs in a circuit and program a connected GUI using Tkinter library in Python is such a way that the LEDs perform certain tasks based on the different buttons. The circuit consists of 2 LEDs (red and green) that can be switch on or off from buttons on the GUI. These LEDs can also be made to blink and fade in and out.  

2. Motion Detection System:

With the help of a camera module and a PIR motion sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi, it is possible to capture images when motion is detected. The PIR motion sensor itself contains two slots, each of which is composed of a specific IR-sensitive substance. When the sensor is turned off, both slots detect the same quantity of IR, which is the ambient amount emitted by the room, walls, or outside. When a warm body, such as a human or animal, passes by, one half of the PIR sensor is intercepted, resulting in a positive differential change between the two halves. When the heated body exits the sensing region, the sensor creates a negative differential change, causing the sensor to generate a negative differential change. These change pulses are what is detected. 

3. Face Detection:

The aim of this project is to connect the camera module to capture pictures and detect the no. of faces. The execution is done using Haar Cascade methodology. Paul Viola and Michael Jones presented the Haar Cascade classifier as an effective object identification technique in their article “Rapid Object Detection with a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001. Using the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, we will attempt to detect the faces of persons in this use-case.

4. Coordinate System:

The MPU6050 is a Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) with a three-axis accelerometer and three-axis gyroscope. This allows us to measure a system's or object's acceleration, velocity, direction, displacement etc. The sensor also helps in detecting the temperature of the environment.
